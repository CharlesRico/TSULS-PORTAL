        <p class="historypar">Tarlac State University - Laboratory High School (Lab School or TSU-LS) is a secondary school in Tarlac City, Philippines. It was established in 1985 under the College of Education of Tarlac State University, aiming to help undergraduate students of the college in their practice teaching.

            The school was located at Lucinda Campus, a 10-hectare property of the University in Binauganan, Tarlac City, along with the College of Education and College of Science.
           
        <br> <br>In 2005, a proposition suggesting to stop its operation was presented due to the inability of the provincial government to support the school. This order was not implemented and it continued to operate. However, after over 10 years, the decision to stop the school's operation was finalized. On April 1, 2016, the last commencement ceremony was conducted for its last batch of students.

            On September 1, 2021, the board of directors of TSU had announced that the Laboratory School will be reinstituted along with offering the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) strand in Senior High School, on the later accepting Junior High School students in the School Year 2022-2023 in July 9, 2022.</p>
